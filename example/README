-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
udpecho

udpecho demonstrates usage of event based UDP sockets. Application receives
data as odp packets, not via sockets. Application sends data back using two
optional methods:
1. standard socket interface, or
2. reusing the same packet and sending it using a packet send function.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
webserver

This is a simple web server that uses sockets as expected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
webserver2

This web server receives requests as odp packets and sends responses
using normal sockets. Benefit is that it is not necessary to have
bookkeeping for the sockets. For example accept is executed to create
necessary data structures but the result (new socket) is ignored.
At the moment there is one restriction: reply length is limited to 63
socket writings.

ioctl_test

Examples how to use ioctl to control sockets, interfaces, and routes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sysctl

Management Information Base (MIB) is a hierarchical database that
describes an application. Object Identifiers (OID) can be used to
read and write variables. Sysctl example demonstrates how to create
new nodes and variables and how to read and write them.
